# Gravitational-Field-Visualization
The model creates a simulation and visualization of a gravitational field around a celestial body using machine learning. 
It first generates synthetic data based on gravitational physics, then uses this data to train a neural network model. 
The model learns to predict gravitational field strength based on mass and distance. 
Once trained, the model is used to create a 2D representation of the gravitational field around a randomly chosen mass. 
The resulting field is visualized using a contour plot, with a logarithmic scale to better show the variations in field strength. 
The visualization includes a color gradient to represent field strength, contour lines for additional detail, and a simple circle to represent the celestial body itself. 
This approach demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to model and visualize complex physical phenomena, providing an intuitive representation of gravitational fields that could be useful for educational or research purposes.
